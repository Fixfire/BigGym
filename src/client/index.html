                  <h3>Is there more to fitness than just working out at the gym?</h3>
                  <p>The answer is..."Yes!" A gym can provide you with many tools and options to help improve your fitness, but it is not your only option. 
                      Improving your fitness means you are trying to improve your overall health. This may mean different things to different people. For one person it might mean improving their ability to play with their grandkids. For another it might mean improving their ability to perform at a certain sport.
