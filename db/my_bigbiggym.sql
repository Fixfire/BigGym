It also helps to reduce stress, promote restful sleep, strengthen muscles and gives the body a more streamline appearance. The number of calories burned depends on the speed of movements, step height, and length of exercise. Exercise sessions can create social connections with others and step as well as low-impact aerobics is suitable for all ages, low cost, and has no restrictions on place.', 'Aerobic training with individual platform with  adjustable height .
